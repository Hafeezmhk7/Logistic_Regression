# Logistic_Regression
I have implemented Logistic regression from scratch using python libraries such as numpy and Pandas.
I have built different helping functions and th whole process have been divided into 5 steps as follows:
1. Intialization of Parameters
2. Calculation of forward propagation, cost and gradient.
3. Applying gradient descent to get updated parameters.
4. Prediction using learned parameters.
5. Logistic Regression Model using initial build helper functions.
